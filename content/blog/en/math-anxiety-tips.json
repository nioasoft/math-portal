  "content": "<h2>What is Math Anxiety?</h2>\n<p>Many children experience significant stress before a math test or even when doing homework. This stress, called \"math anxiety,\" can hurt their performance and create a negative cycle.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Turn Math into a Game</h3>\n<p>Instead of \"practicing,\" play. Use cards, dice, or computer games that incorporate math. The goal is to associate math with a positive experience.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Praise the Effort, Not Just the Result</h3>\n<p>If the child solved correctly, great. If not, but they tried and worked hard - praise them for the effort. \"I can see you really tried hard here.\"</p>\n\n<h3>3. Normalize Mistakes</h3>\n<p>Mistakes are part of learning. Share your own daily mistakes with your children and how you corrected them.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Short and Focused Practice</h3>\n<p>Don't sit for hours on worksheets. 10-15 minutes a day is more effective than two concentrated hours once a week. <a href=\"/\">Use our generator</a> to create focused worksheets.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Use Customized Worksheets</h3>\n<p>Use the generator to create exercises at a level where your child succeeds, and only then gradually increase the difficulty.</p>"
