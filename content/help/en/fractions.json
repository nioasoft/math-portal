  "shortDescription": "Fractions represent parts of a whole. Children learn to read, compare, and perform operations with fractions.",
  "importance": "Fractions are the foundation for understanding percentages, ratios, and advanced mathematics. They're also useful in cooking, measurements, and daily life.",
  "howToTeach": [
    "Start with physical division - half a cake, a quarter of a pizza",
    "Explain that the denominator (bottom) tells how many parts we divided into, and the numerator (top) tells how many parts we took",
    "Practice comparing fractions with the same denominator",
    "Only after solid understanding, move to common denominators"
  ],
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "1/4 + 2/4 = ?",
      "solution": "3/4",
      "explanation": "When denominators are the same, just add the numerators: 1+2=3. The denominator stays 4."
    },
    {
      "problem": "1/2 + 1/4 = ?",
      "solution": "3/4",
      "explanation": "Find a common denominator: 1/2 = 2/4. Now 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4."
    }
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Adding denominators together with numerators (1/2+1/3 is NOT 2/5!)",
    "Forgetting to simplify the final answer",

  "parentTips": [
    "Use pizza, cake, or chocolate for examples",
    "Draw circles and divide them into parts",
    "Show equivalent fractions: 1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8"
