  "shortDescription": "Geometry deals with shapes, sizes, and spatial relationships. Children learn to identify shapes and calculate area and perimeter.",
  "importance": "Geometry develops spatial thinking needed for architecture, design, navigation, and solving engineering problems.",
  "howToTeach": [
    "Start by identifying shapes in the environment - square windows, round clocks",
    "Explain the difference between area (what's inside) and perimeter (the line around)",
    "Teach formulas gradually: rectangle, triangle, circle",
    "Use grid paper for counting before using formulas"
  ],
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "A rectangle with length 5 and width 3. What's the area and perimeter?",
      "solution": "Area: 15, Perimeter: 16",
      "explanation": "Area = length × width = 5×3 = 15. Perimeter = 2×(length+width) = 2×(5+3) = 16."
    },
    {
      "problem": "A triangle with base 8 and height 6. What's the area?",
      "solution": "24",
      "explanation": "Triangle area = (base × height) ÷ 2 = (8×6)÷2 = 48÷2 = 24."
    }
