  "shortDescription": "Sequences are a series of numbers with a constant pattern. Children learn to identify patterns and continue the sequence.",
  "importance": "Pattern recognition is a basic thinking skill. Sequences prepare students for algebra and solving complex problems.",
  "howToTeach": [
    "Start with simple sequences: 2, 4, 6, 8...",
    "Encourage the child to find the 'rule' (what do you do to get from one number to the next)",
    "Practice ascending and descending sequences",
    "Introduce multiplication sequences only after mastery of addition/subtraction sequences"
  ],
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "3, 6, 9, 12, ?",
      "solution": "15",
      "explanation": "The rule is +3 each time. 12+3=15."
    },
    {
      "problem": "2, 4, 8, 16, ?",
      "solution": "32",
      "explanation": "The rule is ×2 each time. 16×2=32."

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Looking for a rule that's too complicated when it's simple",

  ],
  "parentTips": [
    "Start with the question: 'What's the difference between the numbers?'",
    "Encourage the child to explain the pattern in words",
    "Create your own sequences and let the child find the rule"
