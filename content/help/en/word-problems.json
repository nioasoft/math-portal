  "shortDescription": "Word problems are mathematical stories that need to be translated into an equation and solved.",
  "importance": "Word problems teach how to apply mathematics in reality. They develop reading comprehension and logical thinking.",
  "howToTeach": [
    "Teach them to read the problem at least twice",
    "Ask them to mark the numbers and 'key words'",
    "Encourage drawing or making a diagram of the problem",
    "At the end - check if the answer makes sense"

    {
      "problem": "Danny had 15 marbles. He gave 7 marbles to Yossi. How many marbles does Danny have left?",
      "solution": "8",
      "explanation": "Gave = subtraction. 15 - 7 = 8 marbles."

      "problem": "Each row has 6 chairs. There are 4 rows. How many chairs are there in total?",
      "solution": "24",
      "explanation": "Each row × number of rows = multiplication. 6 × 4 = 24 chairs."
    }
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Not reading the entire question to the end",
    "Confusion with key words (gave = subtraction, received = addition)",
    "Not checking if the answer makes sense"

  "parentTips": [
    "Ask the child to tell you the story in their own words",
    "Encourage drawing - it helps understanding!",
    "Ask: 'What are they asking us?' before starting to solve",
    "After solving, ask: 'Does this make sense?'"
